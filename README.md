# ALKit

## A boilerplate code that I'm for building iOS applications
- MVVM+C architecture components
- Commonly used Foundation and UIKit extensions
- Presentable protocols for often presented components e.g. [AlertPresentable.swift](https://github.com/adam-leitgeb/ALKit/blob/master/Sources/ALKit/Components/AlertPresentable.swift)
- Plugin controllers to avoid code duplication, and nice separation of concerns to avoid the dreaded Massive View Controller
